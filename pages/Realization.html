      <p>We research the most diverse to-do lists and schedulers.
        We compare the most different things,
        like the availability on the most different operating systems (Windows, IOS, ...),
        whether they are available through a website, browser extensions, and email extensions.
        We'll see if you can link to language assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.
        In addition, we investigate whether they are chargeable and whether they have a free trial period.</p>
      <p>Besides the different compatibilities we compare the features of the to-do lists.
        If they have a daily planner or if they can be synchronized on different devices.
        You can add several subtasks to a task.
        You can easily set recurring appointments.
        The prioritization of tasks, whether it is possible to add files to an appointment as well as notes.
        Another example is if you can link lists to other accounts.</p>
      <p>Now we want to implement the website for the first semester.</p>
